# Welcome to Rust with Via

This website contains complementary material for 
[Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/), 
an amazing Rust course developed by the Android team at Google. 
It is based on the changes we made to the course while running it at 
[Via](https://ridewithvia.com/)
to make it more suitable for our Python-centric team. 

Our primary motivation for offering this course was to promote the adoption of Rust within Via. 
We believe that Rust's combination of performance, safety, and focus on resilient software aligns well with our organization's goals.
By introducing our colleagues to Rust, we hoped to inspire them to explore its potential benefits and consider incorporating it into their projects.

The course's objectives were to:
* **Convince students of Rust's value:** Highlight Rust's rich type system, strong performance, and modern tooling. 
Demonstrate how Rust's focus on safety can help identify and prevent bugs earlier in the development process, reducing the need for extensive QA and mitigating production issues.
* **Introduce Rust's fundamentals:** Show students that even though Rust definitely has it's complexities, using it to build reliable, performant and useful software is not that hard.
* **Build confidence and motivation:** Equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to feel comfortable and excited about using Rust in their work.

The course was attended by approximately 15 developers from our algorithms group. Given their extensive experience with Python, and the fact the the original course seem more oriented towards C++ developers, we made several adjustments to the original curriculum. 
Most notably, we added a dedicated section and an exercise on using pyo3 to create native Python extensions. Additionally, we replaced some of the exercises with problems that were more relevant to our team's work.

To enhance the learning experience, we encouraged students to use VSCode as their development environment. We spent time setting up VSCode with essential tools like rust analyzer, clippy, and rustfmt to streamline their workflow.

At the conclusion of the workshop, we conducted a survey to gather feedback from the participants. The results were very positive, with 90% of respondents expressing a desire to use Rust in their projects and 80% feeling confident in their ability to do so with appropriate guidance.
You can find the full results [here](survey.md).

We hope that you will find the materials on this site useful and that they will inspire you to explore Rust further. Happy coding!
