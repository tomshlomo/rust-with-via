# Instructor Notes

* This exercise is intended to replace the [ROT13](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/std-traits/exercise.html#exercise-rot13) exercise from the original version.

* Students can choose whether the implementation of `From<Vec<(String, i32)>>` adds the quantities of duplicate names or keeps the last one.

* Ensure that students who finish early use the `entry` API to implement `Add`.
