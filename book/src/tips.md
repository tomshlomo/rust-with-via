# Misc. Tips
* Encourage students to complete the exercises using a real IDE, such as VSCode, rather than a in the browser.
Spend time setting up the IDE with essential tools like Rust Analyzer, Clippy, and rustfmt to optimize their workflow.
* A few days before the course begins, send participants detailed instructions on how to set up their development environment. 
This will allow them to hit the ground running on day one.
* Avoid getting caught up in details that are not critical to the course objectives. 
For example, we found that discussing the behavior of rustc with respect to integer overflow, especially on the first day, wasn't necessary.
* When discussing references, use the terms "exclusive reference" and "shared reference" instead of "mutable reference" and "immutable reference."
