# Welcome
In this section, we will learn how to write Python extension modules in Rust using the [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs) library.

We will cover how to define Python functions, classes, modules, and exceptions in Rust.

PyO3 is a rich library that provides many more features (e.g., interaction with the GIL, async) that we will not cover. However, you are welcome to explore its excellent [documentation](https://pyo3.rs) for more information.
